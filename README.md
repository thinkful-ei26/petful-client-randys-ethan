Welcome to Petful

Petful allows you to adopt either a cat or a dog at the click of a button. Pets are adopted on a first in, first out basis, so only one cat and one dog are available for adoption at a time. We hope you find a furry friend to take home with you!

Petful is built using React and Redux on the front end and Node and Express on the backend, with a simple queue data structure.

The server is deployed at https://petful-er.herokuapp.com/ and the repo can be found at https://github.com/thinkful-ei26/petful-server-randys-ethan.
